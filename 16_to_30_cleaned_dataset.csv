33123,2,22,8.0,"  I'm afraid loneliness is one of those things I've never really understood or been able to relate to, so I'm not actually sure if I'm lonely or not. I've never had any friends â€“ at least, I don't think I have. It's hard to say. What exactly is a friend? How does one recognise a friend? I've spent much of my life working with people from many different backgrounds, both in the public sector as a teacher and college lecturer, and in the voluntary sector. But I don't know how many of them â€“ if any â€“ were friends. As I see it, there are people who like me and people who don't. But when I think of those people who like me, the majority of them I haven't seen for many years, so I'm not sure if I can rightfully count them as 'friends'. That's another problem: at what point does a friend cease to be a friend? After five years? Ten years? Twenty years? I've always felt that there must be a whole plethora of rules governing all these relationships, but I've never really understood how the system works. I am more or less retired now and can often go for several days without seeing or speaking to anyone, but I never really feel lonely. I have a grown-up daughter, to whom I have always been very close; I rarely see her these days as she's working and living away from home, but I still feel close to her. And I have a wife from whom I have been separated for 26 years but our relationship is amicable enough. They are my family. Then there are the people at my church whom I see every Sunday. They all seem to like me. Finally, there are my â€""Facebook friendsâ€ â€“ mostly former students of mine, plus a few cousins I have never met. But we keep in touch and sometimes exchange messages online. So, I suppose I am lonely by virtue of the fact that I lead such an isolated existence nowadays, but I don't actually feel lonely.

2738,2,22,4.0,"Being alone and loneliness is not the same thing. Although it is possible to be both. I came from a very small family. And the culture I lived in then was centred around a lot of social interaction. I am not mature in social interaction, because in my family (eg mum at home all the time, dad away working late) I was kept away from all interaction. I was thought to be wary of other people. I was taught that, Other people were all bad and I had protect myself by keeping a distance, not talking to anyone, always be suspicious of alterior motives, etc. The first opportunity I had, eg age 21 I left this 'home' and moved miles away to be a 'normal' person. So long story short, I am alone, still practising what I learnt. I know full well I am VERY lonely. I can not however trust anyone. I just am resigned to the fact I will stay lonely. My niggle is, when I am old and frail (age 51 now) and unable to take care of myself, I will need to trust others. How will I do this? How will I leave the 'comfort' of my lonely kingdom, and bravely go out to the big bad world and submit to 'help'! Will I be understood after all these years of solidarity. I am seriously concerned of my future. Summary: loneliness; not talking to anyone. Having radio, social media for company. Scared of the noise the letter plate makes when the postman delivers post.

It is very common for one to identify with the external that creates the idea of self, for the process of attempting to define ""who I am"".  Often the mind percieves ones self by comparison, judgement and when one is alone the mind can often trick us to idenitfy with content that establishes that one is lonely.  I live my life understanding that loneliness is only established in the thoughts generated by the mind and each individuals reaction or attachments to those thoughts that often catapults one in feeling lonely.  This is a difficult place to be and one that can be left behind by understanding ""thought"" and ingegrating that we are our own life partner, all else is temporary.

47522,2,21,,"It's a feeling, sometimes almost a physical pain, a sense that something's not there that should be. I don't always feel it when I'm physically on my own, but it's usually most noticeable when I am. I sometimes feel it when I'm around other people, but feel ostracised from them. Recently I've felt lonely not for a lack of friends, but a lack of more meaningful and deep friendship. Having moved to a new place, I'm not as close to anyone yet as I was with friends in my previous home town. I find making friends easy but find building deeper, lasting relationships difficult. My work has made it impossible to spend enough time with people to become really close to them. Me and my friends' mutual busyness makes it hard to find time when we're all free and able to spend time together, which often means I'm forced to spend large parts of my spare time alone. I can be introverted and enjoy quiet space and solitude after periods of busyness or extended interaction with people, but I can start to feel like I've trapped myself in solitude if I withdraw so often that I neglect friendships. I live in a houseshare with three people who I don't see often, and I don't have the space or facilities in my house to entertain guests. This has made me feel parasitic in my friendship groups since I can't return the hospitality they've offered me, and I've begun to feel like I don't have an equal relationship with them, which has made me feel I have nothing to offer to the group and made me want to withdraw. Whenever I try to arrange social time with a particular friendship group, only one or two people usually respond; sometimes it's just one particular person who I have observed finds me attractive although my feelings towards them are entirely platonic.",noticeable ostracised recently friend moved friend previous town friend easy building deeper lasting relationship impossible friend mutual business make free mean forced part spare controverted period business extended start withdraw neglect friendship houseshare three facility entertain guest parasitic group return hospitality offered begun equal offer withdraw whenever arrange particular respond particular observed find attractive feeling towards entirely platonic

I am a non-conformist, and as such do not let people hide behind, and use to excuse their worst behaviour, as they always have, namely religion, family, beliefs, patriotism.

6075,3,22,9.0,"Fundamentally, there is a difference between being alone and loneliness. Solitude can easily be a choice, from temporarily choosing a hobby that routinely results in isolation, to going on holiday alone, to a more permanent lifestyle change through work or the area you choose to live in that gives one the time to be alone as desired. But chronic loneliness chooses you. Whether as a result of an illness or accident, as an unfortunate consequence of a bereavement or a relationship breakdown, or from a change in circumstance like moving away to university or for work, you can suddenly and unwillingly be faced with isolation from meaningful social interactions that can become all consuming and detrimental to your physical and mental wellbeing, something we are now understanding better than ever before. A misconception with loneliness is that you have to be alone to be lonely. And yes is many cases one may be lacking regular human contact or conversations, such as for example with those individuals who are housebound. But loneliness can be more subtle than that. A person with hundreds of friends and a busy job and a packed diary of meetings and events and activities can be just as lonely as the elderly individual trapped in their home by the physical and mental consequences of the human ageing process. It's all about meaning in our interactions with one another, and yes having somebody to say hello to is a good place to start. But those words and the time spent together, no matter how brief, have to be transacted in a way that makes all participants feel loved and worthy and ultimately human. To combat loneliness we have to understand it in all its malignant forms and who is most vulnerable. Loneliness ultimately isolates people from humanity but also removes their own, to remedy those affected feeling cut off from arguably the biggest social group of animals on the planet, and is now being described as an epidemic in a world that has never been more connected. And if that isn't a health issue to be concerned about, maybe we're all losing our humanity.

32595,2,23,6.0,"Loneliness is a blanket which now covers my whole existence. I became ill 24 years ago when I was 30. At that time I had an extremely sociable job, lots of friends and many acquaintances.as the years have passed, many of those friendships have floundered. People were not able to understand the nature of my illness and seemed unable to accommodate it. Friendships were tested in ways they might not have been. I have 3 close friends from that time who have remained loyal and supportive. Maybe the process of illness sorted through my friendships to reveal the true friends. However, the circumstances of my illness, and the fact that I had to relocate geographically means that I very rarely see them, and contact is by text. Because I am unable to work, I experience intense isolation - both social, and emotional. The isolation erodes my sense of self - we get to be â€""our selfâ€ only in relationship to/be with others, to â€""BEâ€. This has eroded my confidence to the degree that I find it hard now to be with others. A vicious circle. I have made about 3 new friends in the last 5 years, all of whom I was drawn to for their empathic understanding, sincerity, acceptance of me as I am, kindness, and a general compatibility. These qualities are this I hope I reciprocate. But I rarely feel physically able to see people.  The weeks pass with the only contact I have is with my elderly parents. I have felt at times that I might die of loneliness. I have always been very good at being alone, preferring to live alone, and needing a lot of alone-time, particularly when my job was so sociable. I still need time alone, but the extreme isolation is mind altering. I have literally felt that it might kill me.

I think that it is a feeling of being apart or different from others even although one may be a part of a group. The feeling of loneliness stems from a disconnection from others, that one is not regarded or included. In today's society it seems as if a persons sense of self worth is co-modified primarily as a valued consumer. People may often feel that they need to fulfill others perceptions and expectations in order to be valued and considered worthy of acknowledgement. If one doesn't fit the bill they are somehow rejected or ignored. For an introvert this involves becoming more extroverted and as result of this introverted people often have to act a role that they don't feel comfortable with. From my experience this often leads to people seeking soothers in the form of alcohol and drugs to mediate feelings of discomfort. Depression and Anxiety lead people to avoid and isolate themselves from others due to fear of feeling inadequate in the eyes of others. This perception leads to shame and guilt, which can best be addressed by being part of a group of people who recognise you as a person of worth and (en)courage one to accept oneself.  I believe that loneliness and solitude are very different. Solitude, for some is a perfect state of being in that it allows for reflective introspection free from feelings of needing to live up to often ill defined and impossible standards.

Physically, I feel an emptiness inside my chest, and a feeling of listlessness, tiredness,  and emptiness.  And I feel like I can't climb out of this situation, because of a countervailing fear. I have a deep fear of protection, that I will extend myself to someone else in friendship or companionship, but be rejected. As painful and miserable as loneliness is,  The feel of being rejected after it happens is far, far worse. So, staying in a lonely state, as miserable as that is, is actually self protective.

20264,1,28,5.0,"Loneliness can be both positive and negative, when you think about 'aloneness'. There can be a feeling of loneliness when everyone else is out of the house, or when you're on a train platform in the middle of nowhere, that is actually bracing. You have to draw on inner strength but this is invigorating. I enjoy being alone, or feeling 'left alone' quite a lot of the time, because I am an introvert. But I do not feel loneliness in the sense of without support or without the option of someone to talk to if I wanted to. So perhaps I have really never experienced that kind of loneliness, the feeling that there would not be company somewhere if I wanted it. I think loneliness and aloneness have to be considered separately, and yet they will blend into each other. If I've been around people too much and am tired of social interaction, I'll want to be alone, and then eventually I feel 'lonely' and will reach out to engage again. So again, loneliness is that need for contact, not merely that the contact isn't there. On the other hand, there can be loneliness in some situations where one isn't alone. As a queer woman I can feel lonely at my workplace even though I like my colleagues and chat happily with them, because I'm not out to them and I feel that they would not react well to knowing that part of me. I have found in the past that when 2 queer people meet in a work situation, there can be a sudden 'thrill' of finding someone - 'Oh, I'm not alone any more'.

2279,2,23,6.0,"Loneliness is the sense of isolation that comes from being apart. Apart from others without a connection. This can be either through physical distance and literal barriers to being able to speak or communicate, a time zone for example. Or that someone or persons near by, just don't get you, they are not on your wavelength or you are not on theirs. So any attempts to communicate fail. The failure is on an emotional level, and is an unsettling, uncanny feeling that punctuates being in the moment. Loneliness often feels like watching yourself from the outside: You are not being in the world. I once heard boredom described as the lack of desiring to desire.

I have encouraged my neighbours to add plants on the end of the garden and this is working.

I chose to do some kind of community work in my neighbourhood every 5 or 6 years since I was 40 (not continuously so as not to wear myself out while working) and that has brought me into contact with a range of ages I do not have a computer at home so have to use the local library computers so that brings me into contact with library staff and other users.

At uni, I discovered life could be different, people even seemed to like me, I had a group of friends and life changed. Since then, episodes of loneliness have been associated with broken relationships which left me feeling temporarily bereft and alone. I ended up a single parent and the next episode of ""loneliness"", or more an internal physical ache, was when my daughter went to uni and the intensity of feeling of loss inside took me by surprise, especially, because, as a parent, one strives to help your child grow up to be independent, successfully leave home and to lead their own happy and independent life. Success!! But such a mixed, powerful feeling. I have suffered from life long depressive episodes requiring antidepressants for the last 15 years, different from loneliness, with marked biological symptoms especially diurnal variation in mood.
